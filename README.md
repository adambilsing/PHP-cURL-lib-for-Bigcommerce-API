PHP-cURL-lib-for-Bigcommerce-API
================================

Require the file in your script as follows:
```
require 'connection.php';
```
Instantiate connection class as such:
```
$store = new connection('Username', 'API path', 'API token');
```
call various methods to the connection

```
$store->get('RESOURCE');

$store->delete('RESOURCE');

$store->post('RESOURCE', $fields);

$store->put('RESOURCE', $fields);
```

If the request fails the error details will be stored in the public $errors member.

If the requests per hour limit reaches 100 or less the library will automatically take 5 minutes between requests in order to provide enough
time for the requests to regenerate.  Once the request limit is above 100 the library will resume requests at a normal frequency.
